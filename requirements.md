# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a pluggable, autonomous AI marketing system that can be integrated into any application to automate the entire marketing funnelâ€”from lead generation to retention. The system is designed as a standalone microservice/SDK that exposes APIs and webhooks, making it framework-agnostic and easy to integrate with existing applications (Flask, Django, Node.js, React, etc.). It leverages AI agents to manage multi-channel campaigns (Google Ads, LinkedIn, ProductHunt), implements Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for intelligent content creation, and uses behavioral intelligence for predictive personalization. The goal is to create a self-optimizing marketing engine that grows leads autonomously, adapts content dynamically, and converts users through data-driven insights while maintaining a lean operational team.
